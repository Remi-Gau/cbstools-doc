You must first gunzip the files using the gunzip matlab command. Note 2: Only volumes (.nii) will be compressed. Surface files (*.vtk) will not. Python wrappers for the CBS tools are available (no installation of MIPAV is required).

It is possible to independently report or modify the qform or sform fields. The qform and sform stored in a nifti file are intended to fulfil the following functions: specify the handedness of the coordinate system (important for getting left and right correct) specify the original scanner coordinates (qform only) specify standard space coordinates (sform only) specify a relationship with another image's coordinates (sform only) From: https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/documentation/nifti1fields/nifti1fields_pages/qsform_brief_usage/document_view MIPAV works on the qform and SPM on the sform. So you might run into problems because of that. More info here: http://gru.stanford.edu/doku.php/mrTools/coordinateTransforms https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Orientation%20Explained The vtk surfaces from the CBS tools have 4 parts: Header Vertices: that parts stays the same between inflated and non inflafed surfaces) Faces Mapping: X values (one column / layer) for each vertex (each row is a vertex). Extracting data from surfaces *.vtk files are text files that can be easily read in simple text editor. I have created a set of matlab function to read, extract data, threshold and write back the data from those surfaces. The gifti function from SPM should do the trick. Otherwise I also wrote write_vtk.m and read_vtk.m files Vizualizing surfaces Use Paraview: http://www.paraview.org/ Drawing ROI on surfaces Use the modified version of Cosmetic Open one of the segmentation layout from: MipavRootFolder/plugins/layouts-r3.0 For example: brain-segmentation-MP2RAGE-7T-MNI-space.LayoutXML Several subjects can be processed in parallel pipelines, but the data must entered in the same order in each input module. If there is only one file in a given module then this file will be used for all subject (e.g. atlas, template\u2026) in parallel pipelines. Several subjects can be processed, but the data must entered in the same order in each input module. If there is only one file in a given module then this file will be used for all subject (e.g. atlas, template\u2026) mipav/plugins/atlases/MNI-template/MNI152_T1_04mm_brain.nii.gz mipav/plugins/atlases/brain-segmentation-prior3.0/brain-atlas-3.0.txt Modules have a number of obligatory inputs: top white pins The top grey pins are either: for optional inputs or parameters that can be read from a file or passed on from another module or set manually in the parameter window The bottom pins are for the output management Modules can easily be linked to one another Modules can also also renamed Save the layout and start the process manager: Project \u2192 Process manager The whole pipeline can be run at once Scheduler-> Start Scheduler Each process with a \u201cready\u201d status, can be started individually (\u201crun\u201d button or Right click \u2192 run) The priority of each process can be modified (Right click \u2192 Promote/Demote) Each parallel pipeline (e.g. subject) gets a different number (0000, 0001, 0002, \u2026) The letters are related to the parent process of the selected process. The data of every step will be saved in the output directory specified in the layout preference and organized as follow: OutputDir/PipelineNumber/Process-ID/ModuleName/ The data of every step will be saved in the output directory specified in the layout preference and organized as follow: OutputDir/PipelineNumber/Process-ID/ModuleName/ If a layout has been modified (change of parameters, new step added, some output files have been moved) some process (and sometimes all of its children processes) might have an \u201cout of sync\u201d status. This can be fixed process by process (Right click \u2192 Clean) or for all the incriminated processes (Scheduler \u2192 Clean Out of Synch). Sometimes a process might fail to complete\u2026 How surprising! To help you debug what could have gone wrong , check the debug.err and debug.out files in folder of that process One of the usual suspect is \u201cNot enough memory\u201d, so either allocate more RAM or run fewer processes at once. Other classical issues: the input file has been moved, you don\u2019t have write access to the output folder, Your hard drive is full! Once you have fixed the issue you can clean and re-run the process. brain-segmentation-*.LayoutXML There is one pipeline optimised for the MP2RAGE of the 7T at the MPI CBS. Will do the high-res segmentation. The final resolution of the end product will be determined by the resolution of the MNI template. brain-segmentation-*.LayoutXML In this pipeline the Full CRUISE cortex extraction module will also create 3D volume level sets necessary for the surface inflation and mapping (central level set) and for layering (white matter-grey matter level set and grey matter-CSF level set). The Surface mesh inflation will create the surface (.vtk) files (normal and inflated): they are based on the surface that goes across the middle of the cortical ribbon The Surface mesh mapping maps the data from the T1 map volume to the central surface. It can also be used to map a ROI defining volume onto a surface in case we want to only extract certain vertices from that surface. brain-segmentation-*.LayoutXML Manual sanity checks and inspection after: Skull stripping T1 map before (T1_map _transform.nii) vs. T1 map after (T1_map _strip.nii) skull stripping Segmentation T1 map before (T1_map _bound.nii) vs. T1 map after (T1_map _seg.nii) segmentation brain-segmentation-*.LayoutXML Manual sanity checks and inspection after: Other important modules Volumetric layering module defines X layers using The WM-GM and GM-CSF 3D volumes level sets from the CRUISE module to create a 4D volume of defining X+1 surfaces using level sets (_surf.nii) with X+1 volume in the 4th dimension a 3D volume layer label defining volume (_labels.nii) with X+1 labels (0 is for anything that is non-cortex). The Profile sampling will sample the values of an intensity image (like the beta image of a GLM) to create the profiles along the X+1 surfaces defined by the 4D level set files of the layering. The Surface mesh mapping can then be used to map those different surfaces by projecting them onto a reference surface (usually the central surface from the segmentation pipeline). The resulting *.vtk files has X+1 surfaces. Other important modules Smooth surface mesh data will smooth the data along a surface (*.vtk) with a given FWHM Level set to mesh converts a level set to a .vtk surface (no inflation). Embedded Syn does non linear co-registration and can for example be used to correct for motion X inhomogeneity interactions. It requires to install the Advanced Normalization Tools http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/ and will only work on linux as it calls some bash scripts (see the layer-fmri-analysis.Layout for a very simple example) Multimodal surface registration for surface based registration Mesh data to volume to map a surface onto a volume: needs a reference volume for dimensions, also make sure that the surface you input in non-inflated. Necessary to define in a volume a ROI drawn on a surface.","title":"Docs"}]}
